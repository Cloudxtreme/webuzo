1) MODIFY the zp-core/index.php and recopy the original for the installSignature(); and change the Offset from 0 to 2 in the same file.
2) mod_rewrite should be OFF in the DB
3) In the DB zenphoto_install should be '' (blank) as the first change here makes the Signature
4) If you are unable to login after Upgrade place the following code in zp-core/setup/setup-option-defaults.php near line 36

	add '$oldhash = getOption('extra_auth_hash_text');'
		and edit 'setOptionDefault('extra_auth_hash_text', NULL);'
	to 'setOptionDefault('extra_auth_hash_text', (empty($oldhash) ? NULL : $oldhash));'

5) In sql file Gallery Title and Description are serialized so the serialization is done in our install.php
6) Copy the favicon.ico, robots.txt and /zp-data/.htaccess from the manual and configure them
7) In zenphoto.cfg keep ($conf['CHMOD'] = 0755;) not 775 not 0777 (If it is there)
8) In sql for every install it keep zenphoto_captcha_key same so NO need to change
9) Choose MySQLi as database engine in manual installation.
10) Always check for languages.
11) We changed php requirement to 5.4.0 because it doesn't work on PHP 5.2.x and 5.3.x
12) We rename /themes/default folder(if exists) during upgrade because after upgrading to 1.4.6 we get deprecated error message on end user page.
13) We configure "zenphoto.cfg.bak.php" because installation creates it.
