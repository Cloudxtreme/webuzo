1. We download the upgrade package and add it to upgrade.zip as it is required to carry on upgrade.
2. Change the $allowed_ver in upgrade.php every time there is an update becuase the script can be updated only from successive versions i.e. 2.3.1 to 2.3.2
3. We have disabled Upgrade because upgrade is done automatically from admin panel.
