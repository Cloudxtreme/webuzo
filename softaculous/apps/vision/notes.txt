2. Copy the PHP 5.3 package as vision.zip and copy PHP 5.2 package to packages/vision_php52.zip and PHP 5.4 package as packages/vision_php54.zip (package should be ground zero zip)
3. (At the moment languages is disabled) To enable language we have changed "is_enabled" in avis_language table from 0 to 1 for all languages.
4. Always check upgrade.php to change version
5. Language is not supported in 4.0.2 so we have removed it. Please add it back once developer adds language packs.
