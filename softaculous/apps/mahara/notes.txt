Install Manually on Webuzo PHP 5.4.

1. Edit config.php file before runing the installer 

	- $cfg->dbtype   = 'mysql';
	- Add $cfg->dbprefix = ''; (Removed since v16.04.0, check in the version for the same)
	- Fill database details
	- also edit $cfg->dataroot
	- Run the installer.

2. When you create database choose utf8_unicode not general
3. Delete all the contents and folders in the sub-directories of the data.zip i.e. keep only the empty folders in root directory (NOT NEEDED NOW BCOZ OF NEW METHOD)
4. We have added alter query in install.php to set collation to UTF8
7. Change the " to ` in the Trigger statements in the SQL file. (NOT NEEDED NOW BCOZ OF NEW METHOD)
8. This might not work on AMPPS and Webuzo because the database user does not have Trigger permissions.(Removed this from version 1.9.1, as its working fine on both now.)
9. Change the value of `passwordchange` field in the `usr` table to 0 so that it does not ask for a password change after the first login. (NOT NEEDED NOW BCOZ OF NEW METHOD)
10. Please go through the upgrade.php requirements at every new release.
11. We always un-comment the $cfg->passwordsaltmain in "config.php".
12. Copy upgrade.php from lib folder and keep as org_upgrade.php and our changes in mod_upgrade.php
