		<font size="5" color="#182e7a">libcap</font> is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital photography (image). The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

Variable compression is possible. Jpeg files can be compressed to a very small file size, while still retaining some quality. For detailed files that require higher quality, you can choose to use less compression.
