1)Select database driver as "MySQLi"

2) Removed unset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST\']); in localconfig.php If it is required in next version than add it.

3)Add following line in localconfig.php to disable maintenance mode:
$GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']['maintenanceMode'] = false;

4) After removing inserts from tl_log table change auto increment

5) Make script where Database ENGINE is InnoDB

6) Don't convert contao.sql to utf8(As enduser won't work if you convert it).

7) We do not delete the install.php because they have not mentioned in their guide to delete it and it allows to import templates using this file.
