1. We do not provide Upgrade becuase :
Upgrading is NOT available for those who were using StoreMailsInDb key to keep all the mails in the database rather than on filesystem. In general, we recommend installing WebMail Lite 6.* from scratch. Before any upgrade attempts, be sure to backup your installation completely. We have enabled upgrade it works from 6.5.0
2. Make script where Database ENGINE is InnoDB
