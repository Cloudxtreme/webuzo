* Do not download Weekly Built.
1) Empty the cache folder in data.zip
2) Use "defaultcity" for city while installing and country United States
3) Check upgrade.php for the upgrade after version 2.5
4) Download the Language packs here:
http://download.moodle.org/langpack/
5) Unpack the packages in the /languages/[[language]].zip
6) Change the language [[language]] in SQL config and users table.
7) If you get error during upgrade stating that there are few files that needs to be removed then check this function:
upgrade_stale_php_files_present() in the file :
/lib/upgradelib.php
8) required minimum version check for upgrade in info.xml should be changed in case of major version change
9) We do not change $CFG->directorypermissions = 0777; in the config file because it is outside the web-accessible directory and does not matter if it is 0777
10) Check if /muc/config.php file is created in data folder on non suPHP server i.e. (you can use Webuzo).
11) `allversionshash` in config table is same for every install
12) `assignfeedback_editpdf` has the value '/usr/bin/gs' on Windows as well as Linux Manual install hence we leave it as it is.
