Collabtive 1.0
+ Added translations: Hebrew, Norwegian (Nynorsk), Taiwanese
+ Improved translations: Albanian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Danish, Farsi, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Slovak, Serbian, Turkish
+ Added translations of install-readme: Hungarian
+ Improved translations of install-readme: Arabic
+ Changed name of autoload function to cl_autoload and added it with spl_autoload_register() to autoload list, to not interfere other autoloaders
+ Implemented automatic update notification.
+ Completely re-written the PDF export. It now uses a custom subclass of TCPDF to directly draw the tables for the reports from arrays instead of using an HTML intermediate.
  This greatly speeds up PDF generation (esp when many lines are exported) and generates much smaller PDFs.
+ Fixed problem with missing "webcolor" variable in TCPDF
+ Improved the project log PDF report by merging fields, improving shading and adding automatic font stretching.
+ Added new PDF report to the "my tasks" block on the desktop. Now a user can export all his tasks to PDF.
+ Re-enabled permissions checking when deleting a timetracker entry. This got disabled for testing purposes and was commited to trunk. Disabling it posed a possible security risk.
+ Added permissions checking to timetracker:add and timetracker:edit . Permissions set in the useraccount where not properly enforced for the timetracker before.
+ Rewrote the settings functionality to work with a key/value table as the datastore. This makes extensibility easier.
+ Ported all database access from mysql_ to PDO. This became necessary because mysql_ will be deprecated in future versions of PHP.
  It uses stored procedures for all UPDATE and INSERT queries which brings improved security and performance (caching) advantages.
  Also, PDO supports a plethora of databases which should make supporting other databases than mysql much easier than before. (Contributed by Mwirtz)
+ Started porting SELECT queries to use stored procedures as well. This brings security and performance (caching) advantages.
+ Ported install.php and update.php to also use PDO
+ Replaced the Excel Export by a more robust CSV export. The excel export was based on an outdated library and not fully compatible with newer versions of Excel and OpenOffice.
  With CSV Collabtive can now export to a widely used serialisation format that can easily be read into Excel, OpenOffice, and many more.
+ Switched to using a precompiled static CSS file in production instead of dynamically compiling it at runtime. This saves many call to the php interpreter.
+ Removed the tabs "my tasks", "my projects", "my messages" from the tabs bar on the desktop.
  Those tabs were redundant for quite some time now. All their information is, in condensed form, also available on the desktop. they can be reinstated by editing tabsmenue-deskt.tpl
+ Fixed a bug preventing people from uploading avatar images
+ Changed the truncation of project titles and task titles on the desktop slightly to prevent http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8750#p17251
+ Made timetracker show closed tasks in addition to open tasks when editing a task ( http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8749 )
+ When clicking on a folder, set the folder in the select menu for "add file" and "add folder" to the clicked folder.
  This way you can upload into a folder you just clicked straight away.
+ Removed the "visibility" functionality for folders ...finally
+ Removed IE7 compatibility
+ Files: Made listview/gridview switch respect the currently selected folder when switching views
+ Made the uploader respect the currently selected folder when refreshing. Now after an upload is complete the view will refresh the subfolder to which a file has been uploaded and not always the main folder.
+ When editing tasks or projects in tables (i.e. on the desktop) the edit form is now displayed in the top block where the add project/task form is also displayed. This eliminates the need for a dedicated "edit" page.
+ Enabled multi-byte safe truncation for strings (makes PHP extension "mbstring" required)
+ Properly enforce user permissions for uploading files, moving files (file_edit), deleting folders (file_del), adding folders (file_add) on the controller/script level. Not only on the template/view level.
+ Added RTL enabled version of the default theme. Contributed by mrawi.
+ Implemented "view" permission. It enables you to define roles that can only view certain parts of a project. For example a role that can view milestones, tasks and messages,  but not files and the timetracker in a project.
+ Added "Add task" slider to the "my tasks" block on the desktop. This way a user can add tasks to himself straight from the desktop.
+ Fix shading of the content table. When clicking "add task" or "add project" on the desktop the table with existing tasks / projects is now correctly shaded.
+ Made the page update.php translatable
+ Improved the design of the installer/updater
+ Fixed a notice in system administration / user profile when a language string was not translated
+ Fixed a bug that asked for the "add" permission instead of the "reply" permission before posting a reply

+ Fixed a notice when displaying messages
+ Fixed link in the email notifications for message-replies to point to the replied to message instead of the reply
+ Send email notifications to all assigned users when creating a project, not just when adding users afterwards.
+ Bulleted lists now displayed correctly... finally.
+ Added mimetype icon for PNG images uploaded with IE which is image/x-png and not image/png
+ Fixed a notice when searching

+ Fixed minor glitch in the form for adding a timetracker entry
+ Substituted deprecated PHP function split() used in e-mail handling by PHP function explode()
+ Made sure to only offer the password reset function (via e-mail) when e-mail notifications are activated
+ Made the asynchronous refresh after file upload is complete a bit quicker. the uploader used to wait 1s before refreshing - this is now reduced to 500ms.

Collabtive 0.7.6
+ Added Estonian translation
+ Fixed timetracker filtering
+ Fixed a problem in countLanguageStrings() that would throw warnings on the system admin page when there was an empty folder in the /language/ folder
+ Files can now be moved up in the folder hierarchy by dragging them onto the "folder up" icon / titlebar
+ Display the complete path of the folder in the add folder ("Parent folder") and add file ("folder") forms, instead of just the foldernames
+ Display the complete path in the titlebar of the file manager, instead of just the current folder
+ Filemanager can now be switched between Gridview (default) and listview (new)
+ Set sensible defaults for time formating in admin->system
+ Implemented asynchronous file upload, with real progress indicator (for browsers that can support it)
+ Removed open ID login option. it was based on a terribly outdated library that only supports openID 1.0, which possibly poses a security problem.
+ Improved file type checking for avatar uploads to prevent non-image files from being uploaded to the avatar directory. This improves security.
+ Removed some dead code paths from manageproject.php
+ Added a security check to install.php to prevent it from being used after Collabtive has already been installed.
+ Fixed a bug where, when clicking "delete" on a folder and answering the "are you sure" prompt with "no", the folder would be faded out as if deleted (though not really deleted)
