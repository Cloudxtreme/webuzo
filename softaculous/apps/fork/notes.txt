4) The version in the __requirements() in Upgrade.php should be increased when there is a Major Upgrade because it is not possible to upgrade to a Major version. This is now handled by info.xml <min_require> tag so we do not need to make changes in upgrade.php

5) No values in timezones table from 3.9.5. Check in the next version.

6) check and update version in upgrade.php if it upgrade requires to delete appProdProjectContainer.php

7) <requirement check="php" type="extension" name="pcre" version="8" operator="ge"><![CDATA[ PCRE Library Version => (8.(\d){2}) ]]></requirement> Add this entry in info.xml once softaculous bug is fixed and launched. Also update <softversion>
