		<font size="5" color="#182e7a">Simple PHP Poll</font> will be as its title suggests: simple. With simplicity in mind, we try to add as many features as possible to our system while still making it extremely simple to use and update, let alone modify. It is the only free poll system to use an installer and simple admin panel, and the only to be free of any watermarks
