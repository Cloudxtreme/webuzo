			<h3>Reliability</h3>
				<p>
				  RabbitMQ offers a variety of features to let you trade off
				  performance with reliability, including persistence,
				  delivery acknowledgements, publisher confirms, and high
				  availability.
				</p>		
				<h3>Flexible Routing</h3>
				<p>
				  Messages are routed through exchanges before arriving at
				  queues. RabbitMQ features several built-in exchange types
				  for typical routing logic. For more complex routing you
				  can bind exchanges
				  together or even write your own exchange type as a
				  plugin.
				</p>		
				<h3>Clustering</h3>
				<p>
				  Several RabbitMQ servers on a local network can
				  be clustered together, forming
				  a single logical broker.
				</p>		
				<h3>Federation</h3>
				<p>
				  For servers that need to be more loosely and unreliably
				  connected than clustering allows, RabbitMQ offers a
				  federation model.
				</p>		
				<h3>Highly Available Queues</h3>
				<p>
				  Queues can be mirrored across several
				  machines in a cluster, ensuring that even in the event of
				  hardware failure your messages are safe.
				</p>		
				<h3>Multi-protocol</h3>
				<p>
				  RabbitMQ supports messaging over a
				  variety of messaging protocols.
				</p>		
				<h3>Many Clients</h3>
				<p>
				  There are RabbitMQ clients for almost
				  any language you can think of.
				</p>		
				<h3>Management UI</h3>
				<p>
				  RabbitMQ ships with an easy-to
				  use management UI that allows
				  you to monitor and control every aspect of your message
				  broker.
				</p>		
				<h3>Tracing</h3>
				<p>
				  If your messaging system is misbehaving, RabbitMQ
				  offers tracing support to let
				  you find out what's going on.
				</p>		
				<h3>Plugin System</h3>
				<p>
				  RabbitMQ ships with a variety
				  of plugins extending it in
				  different ways, and you can
				  also write your own.
