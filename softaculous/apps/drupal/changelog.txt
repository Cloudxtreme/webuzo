Drupal 7.43, 2016-02-24
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2016-001.

Drupal 7.42, 2016-02-03
-----------------------
- Stopped invoking hook_flush_caches() on every cron run, since some modules
  use that hook for expensive operations that are only needed on cache clears.
- Changed the default .htaccess and web.config to block Composer-related files.
- Added static caching to module_load_include() to improve performance.
- Fixed double-encoding bugs in select field widgets provided by the Options
  module. The fix deprecates the 'strip_tags' property on option widgets and
  replaces it with a new 'strip_tags_and_unescape' property (minor data
  structure change).
- Improved MySQL 5.7 support by changing the MySQL database driver to stop
  using the ANSI SQL mode alias, which has different meanings for different
  MySQL versions.
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.39 which prevented autocomplete
  functionality from working on servers that are not configured to
  automatically recognize index.php.
- Updated the Archive_Tar PEAR package to the latest 1.4.0 release, to fix bugs
  with tar file handling on various operating systems.
- Fixed fatal errors on node preview when a field is displayed in the node
  teaser but hidden in the full node view. The fix removes a
  field_attach_prepare_view() call from the node_preview() function since it is
  redundant with one in the node preview theme layer.
- Improved the description of the "Trimmed" format option on text fields
  (translatable string change, and minor UI and data structure change).
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.41, 2015-10-21
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (open redirect). See SA-CORE-2015-004.

Drupal 7.40, 2015-10-14
-----------------------
- Made Drupal's code for parsing .info files run much faster and use much less
  memory.
- Prevented drupal_http_request() from returning an error when it receives a
  201 through 206 HTTP status code.
- Added support for autoloading traits via the registry on sites running PHP
  5.4 or higher.
- Allowed the user-picture.tpl.php theme template to have HTML classes besides
  the default "user-picture" class printed in it (markup change).
- Fixed the URL text filter to convert e-mail addresses with plus signs into
  mailto: links.
- Added alternate text to file icons displayed by the File module, to improve
  accessibility (string change, and minor API addition to theme_file_icon()).
- Changed one-time login link failure messages to be displayed as errors or
  warnings as appropriate, rather than as regular status messages (minor UI
  change and data structure change).
- Changed the default settings.php configuration to exclude private files from
  the "404_fast_paths" behavior.
- Changed the page that displays filter tips for a particular text format, for
  example filter/tips/full_html, to return "page not found" or "access denied"
  if the format does not exist or the user does not have access to it. This
  change adds a new menu item to the Filter module's hook_menu() entry (minor
  data structure change).
- Added a new hook, hook_block_cid_parts_alter(), to allow modules to alter the
  cache keys used for caching a particular block.
- Made drupal_set_message() display and return messages when "0" is passed in
  as the message to set.
- Fixed non-functional "Files displayed by default" setting on file fields.
- The "worker callback" provided in hook_cron_queue_info() and the "finished"
  callback specified during batch processing can now be any PHP callable
  instead of just functions.
- Prevented drupal_set_time_limit() from decreasing the time limit in the case
  where the PHP maximum execution time is already unlimited.
- Changed the default thousand marker for numeric fields from a space ("1 000")
  to nothing ("1000") (minor UI change: https://www.drupal.org/node/1388376).
- Prevented malformed theme .info files (without a "name" key) from causing
  exceptions during menu rebuilds. If an .info file without a "name" key is
  found in a module or theme directory, Drupal will now use the module or
  theme's machine name as the display name instead.
- Made the format column in the {date_format_locale} database table
  case-sensitive, to match the equivalent column in the {date_formats} table.
- Fixed a bug in the Statistics module that caused JavaScript files attached to
  a node while it is being viewed to be omitted from the page.
- Added an optional 'project:' prefix that can be added to dependencies in a
  module's .info file to indicate which project the dependency resides in (API
  addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2299747).
- Fixed various bugs that occurred after hooks were invoked early in the Drupal
  bootstrap and that caused module_implements() and drupal_alter() to cache an
  incomplete set of hook implementations for later use.
- Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff" when possible, to prevent
  certain web browsers from picking an unsafe MIME type.
- Prevented the database API from executing multiple queries at once on MySQL,
  if the site's PHP version is new enough to do so. This is a secondary defense
  against SQL injection (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2463973).
- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused the upgrade
  to fail when there were multiple file records pointing to the same file.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.
