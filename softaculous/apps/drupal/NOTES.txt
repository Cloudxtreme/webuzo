1) Disable Clean URL while installing - Check in the Database for 'clean_url' - it should be 's:1:"0";' 
2) Default Timezone should be ZERO I.e UTC +0000 and keep default country NONE
3) Leave "Check for updates automatically ", "Email notifications"  as it is.
4) Delete cache_menu item INSERT (not table) 
5) Delete all watchdog INSERTS And also change its AUTO INCREMENT =1 ; 
6) We copy the original update.php from zip and add the following lines for upgrading from Drupal 6: 

// Softaculous Change :
$update_free_access = true;
7) Change the version of Drupal 6 in the upgrade.php and <min_require> tag in info.xml if there is an upgrade in Drupal 6 branch.
8) Dont change 'datestamp' to timestamp in DB. It is the launch date
9) We do not copy .htaccess from /sites/default/files/.htaccess because Drupal creates it.
10) In next update change the datestamp to a variable  [[datestamp]] and update the datestamp everytime in install.php
11) Try to detect if Clean URL will work and update accordingly in database
