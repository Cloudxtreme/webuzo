------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix security issues reported by Tim Coen of Curesec.com:

      - Forbid uploading files with PHP contents and possible
        PHP execution by authenticated users (critical if
        you have possible untrustworthy authors)
      - Add proper escaping for comment approval tokens to prevent
        SQL injection (authenticated authors only)
      - Add proper escaping of comment's author names in the
        comment reply form to prevent XSS (2k11 template, javascript
        based)

    * Minor layout fixes for media DB media filters

    * Backported some Importer db bugfixes

      p tags around extraAllowedContent tags.

    * Smarty bugfix upgrades to 3.1.27 - please read the changelog.
      Compilation time was vastly improved.
      New Features in NEW_FEATURES.txt.

    * It is now possible to switch to a theme's admin theme if it has
      been selected as a frontend theme first

    * Syndication Plugin Issue #285:
        - Add "none" as possible value for the xml-icon in the
          syndication plugin, to enable plain links
        - Reset subtome full icon path to support
          serendipity_getTemplateFile()
        - Link creation fixes for Bulletproof coloured style (eg blue)

Version 2.0.1 (March 12th, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Fix missing escaping (possible XSS) of category names in the Backend 
     Entry Admin, which would allow editors that create a forged
     category name to attack other editors in the backend (privileged
     access to the backend required).
     Thanks a lot to Edric Teo for reporting this issue.
     
   * Improved detection for possible upgrade/plugin/PHP errors. A
     warning will be emitted on the dashboard, when the Serendipity
     JavaScript-library could not be loaded.
     
   * syndication fix: use absolute urls for subtome
   
   * Issue 306: localStorage may be deactivated by setting a config
     option or using security-related extensions at least in some
     browsers, which might (at least in FF) break backend JS
     functionality. Added extra tests to 2k11 backend JS.

     If you use localStorage, please test if it is actually available
     by testing if localStorage !== null in JS.

   * Issue 280: Allow every theme to utilize a "user.css" file
     that gets loaded on top of the frontend (or backend, if in admin/
     subdirectory) theme. This file can be used for customized CSS
     of a blog-admin which carries over to future Serendipity updates

   * Issue 299: Do not display dashboard for users with no permission
     to perform actions in the backend (frontend-users)

   * Make "rewriteURL" smarty modifier available to do a
     {$CONST.PATH_ARCHIVE|rewriteURL} within a smarty template file.

   * Add a generic odd/even for backend dashboard widgets to align
     properly. Future dashboard widgets need to get the new extra
     class dashboard widget on the section element they create.

   * Fix event emoticate plugin to reflect proper call usage of
     serendipity_getTemplateFile(), if a theme uses custom emoticons.
     UPDATE your themes emoticons.inc.php file, if have.
            See example file in plugin dir.

   * Change 2k11 config.inc.php to reflect proper
     serendipity_getTemplateFile() when frontend files shall be
     referenced within the backend.

   * Fixed missing file message for deleted media items

   * Fixed entry editor JS not emitting a 'No tags' msg in taxonomy
     quick view. Improved serendipity.tagsList exit if freetag
     plugin is not installed.

   * Minor backend UI fixes (taxonomy quick view in entry editor,
     'Done' msg emitted by Bayes plugin)

   * Clearer language constants for entries in dashboard, labelled
     "In progress"

Version 2.0 (January 23rd, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Smarty fix for purging compiled files

    * Fix wrong search page ordering when stable archive was active

    * Prevent entryproperties from saving/displaying a browser-side
      stored password that was actually not set.

    * Stronger check for existing logger interface to prevent errors
      when it is not actively used.

    * Fix entryproperties being removed when publishing an article
      from the dashboard and by specific plugins (freetag, trackback)
      that modify entry data.

    * Fix deleting comments when user is not an admin, but the entry
      belongs to him. Thanks to berberic.

    * Patch PEAR.php to use "static" isError declaration to prevent
      PHP error messages

    * Change order of IF-statements in entries.tpl to check for
      comment_moderate/comment_added, to properly emit the message
      whether a comment is being moderated.

    * Fix searching for entries in the admin panel with database
      types other than "mysql"

    * Change entry editor's category assignment to toggle between
      a hierarchical and a plain list (good for many categories)

    * Fix date formatting in entry editor to not use ISO year
      but the calendar year

    * Fix autoupdate version read and transmit
