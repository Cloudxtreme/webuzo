Release Notes for 2.4
---------------------------
Omeka 2.4 was released on January 21, 2016.

PHP Requirements Changes
	Omeka 2.4 requires PHP 5.3.2 or higher. Previous versions have worked with the PHP 5.2 series, so be sure to check what version you're running before you upgrade.
	Omeka 2.4 now supports PHP 7.

Audio and Video Support Changes
	To keep up with the changing browser support landscape, Omeka now uses HTML 5's audio and video tags when embedding audio and video, instead of the object and embed tags used by previous versions.

	This change means generally better support for newer formats on current desktop and mobile browsers (for example, fixing a bug where audio files would improperly auto-play on Chrome), but worse support for older video formats, particularly those that rely on browser plugins like Quicktime, Windows Media Player or VLC. Site visitors will still be able to download those older videos and view them locally, provided they have a video player installed that's capable of playing them.

	Added embedded audio support for .m4a and .opus
	Added embedded video support for .m4v and .webm
	Removed embedded audio support for .mid, .midi, .kar, .rmi and .wma
	Removed embedded video support for .avi, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpe, .m1v, .m2v, .qt, and .wmv
	For more information about HTML 5 media support in Omeka, see Media Files.

Bugs Fixed
	Installation could fail on servers running newer versions of MySQL (5.7+) (#678)
	Counting tags could become extremely slow on installations with many tags and tagged records (#674)
	New version detection could sometimes throw an uncaught exception when failing to connect
	Items would not filter correctly using an Item Type object
	Some old "cellspacing" and "cellpadding" attributes were used instead of their CSS counterparts
	An exception within the Navigation component was not properly thrown, leading to an error
	The default files/show view had a mismatched closing div tag

Localization
	Pluralized strings are now supported
	New translation for Mongolian (mn)
	Updates to many existing translations

Zend Framework 1.12.17

	HTML Purifier 4.7.0
	jQuery 1.12.0
