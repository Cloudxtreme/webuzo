2015-09-25

 - Fix import inline a URL

# 2.5.1
-------------------------------------

    Fix problems with less being async in some browsers
    Minor fix only likely to affect programmatic usage of ruleset find
    Fix error when a namespaced mixin is invoked in global scope
	
	
# 2.5.0
-------------------------------------

 - supports the scoped @plugin directive to load function plugins
 - All directives are bubbled (e.g. supports), not just media
 - Performance improvements to the parser - should help non-chrome browsers with very large less files to be alot quicker.
 - the image size function respects include paths like other file functions
 - colour functions take a relative argument that applies percentages relatively instead of absolutely
 - include paths now allows : as a separator on windows (recognising and not splitting drive names by the backslash)
 - @import (css) does not pull the directive above comments
 - Fix for import statements without quotes sometimes causing issues
 - replace supports dimensions and colours
 - the browser field is set in the package.json for use with browserify
 - another fix to support paths being passed as a string instead of an array
 - detached rulesets can be used as default arguments
 - Fix alot of false warnings about extends
 - errors written to stderr more consistently
 - consistently keep units if strict units is off
 - Better support for comments in function all arguments


# 2.3.1
-------------------------------------

 - Fix depends option (regression in 2.3.0)
 - Support parent selector (&) used in sub element expression (e.g. :not(.c_&))

# 2.2.0
-------------------------------------

 - do not apply relative paths to svg-gradient and data-uri functions data-uri output
 - using import filename interpolation and import inline together now works
 - deprecate the compression option (still works, but outputs a warning unless silent)
 - The node version of less now has image-size, image-width, image-height which return the image dimensions of a file
 - Fixed an issue that could cause the parse to occur more than once and the callback be called multiple times
 - if you are outputting to the console, lessc defaults to silent so warnings do not end up in output
 - isunit function supports '' to test if a dimension has no unit
 - data-uri function now counts characters after base64 encoding instead of bytes before encoding to determine ie8 support
 - fix bug effecting guards on pseudo class selectors
 - do not cache on the browser when used with modifyVars
 - detection if less does not parse last character in file
 - detection of whether a file is css now requires /css, .css, ?css, &css instead of just css. You can still tell less the type of file using import options.
 - remove extra new line added to sourcemap entry inline file
 - support safari extension
 - less.parse now exposes a way to get the AST. We do not recommend you use this unless you need to.
