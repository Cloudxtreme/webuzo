		<english-overview>
		<font size="5" color="#182e7a">Dovecot</font> is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind.
		<br /><br />
		Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory.
		<br /><br />
		Dovecot is distributed under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">The MIT License (MIT)</a>

<p>Some of the most notable features of Dovecot include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dovecot is among the <strong>highest performing</strong> IMAP servers
   while still supporting the <strong>standard</strong>
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/mbox">mbox</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/Maildir">Maildir</a>
   formats. The mailboxes are transparently indexed, which gives Dovecot its
   good performance while still providing full compatibility with existing
   mailbox handling tools.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is <strong>standards compliant</strong>. Dovecot v1.1 passes
   all <a href="http://imapwiki.org/ImapTest/ServerStatus">IMAP server
   standard compliancy tests</a> while most other servers fail many of
   them.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's indexes are <strong>self-optimizing</strong>. They contain
   exactly what the user's client commonly needs, no more and no less.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is <strong>self-healing</strong>. It tries to fix most of the
   problems it notices by itself, such as broken index files. The problems are
   however logged so the administrator can later try to figure out what caused
   them.</li>

  <li>Dovecot tries to be <strong>admin-friendly</strong>. Common error
   messages are made as easily understandable as possible. Any crash, no
   matter how it happened, is considered a bug that will be fixed.</li>

  <li>Dovecot allows mailboxes and their indexes to be modified by multiple
   computers at the same time, while still performing well. This means that
   Dovecot <strong>works well with clustered filesystems</strong>.
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/NFS">NFS has caching problems</a>,
   but you can work around them with <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Director">
   director proxies</a>.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's user authentication is extremely flexible and feature-rich,
   supporting many different
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication">authentication
   databases</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/Mechanisms">mechanisms.</a>
   </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> 2.3+ and
   <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a> 4.64+ users can do SMTP
   authentication directly against Dovecot's authentication backend without
   having to configure it separately.</li>

  <li>Dovecot supports easy
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Migration">migration from many existing
   IMAP and POP3 servers</a>, allowing the change to be transparent to
   existing users.</li>

  <li>Dovecot supports <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Clients">workarounds</a>
   for several bugs in IMAP and POP3 clients. Since the workarounds may cause
   the protocol exchange to be slightly less optimal, you can enable only the
   workarounds you need.</li>

  <li>Dovecot's <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Design/Processes">design</a>
   and <a href="/doc/securecoding.txt">implementation</a> is highly focused on
   security. Rather than taking the traditional road of just fixing
   vulnerabilities whenever someone happens to report them,
   <a href="security.html">I offer 1000 EUR</a> of my own money to the first
   person to find a security hole from Dovecot.</li>

  <li>Dovecot is easily extensible.
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins">Plugins</a> can add new commands,
   modify existing behavior, add their own data into index files or even add
   support for new mailbox formats. For example
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Quota">quota</a> and
   <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/ACL">ACL support</a> are completely
   implemented as plugins.</li>
