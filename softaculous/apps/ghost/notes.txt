1. Remove sqlite3 from package.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json since we use MySQL
2. Added the path to node binary in package.json
3. We are restarting node.js twice during upgrade because it does not work first time. Try to remove this in the next version of Ghost(This is removed from version 0.5.1)
4. Check and update Nodejs Recommended version : http://support.ghost.org/supported-node-versions/ ( we provide "Recommended version" i.e 0.10.40 (latest))
