New features

    Added a new form so users and clients can reset their password. *
    Added the possibility to set an expiry date to any file.
    Added an option to select if expired files should be hidden from the clients, or shown but not allowed to download.
    Added a template editor so each system email text, and the general header/footer can be customized.
    Added the possibility to set any file as public, which allows downloading via a tokenized link. Can be combined with the expiry date feature.
    New options to select the maximum attemps to send each notification, and also an expiration date (globally, in days).
    You can now search within the orphan files list. Also, it now has pagination.
    Each password field now has a toggle button for visibility, and the “confirm password” fields were removed.
    Added a new button on the files uploads page to copy the selected assignations of the current file to all others.
    The download log is stored on a separate table. This allows the system to recognize the date each file has been downloaded.
    Files (on the manage files page) can now be sorted by download count.

Fixes

    Implemented phpass for secure passwords.
    Fixed the notifications being sent multiple times.
    Changed the way the download link is generated to improve security.
    More validations are made when a file is requested for download.
    Fixed the back button so it won’t work after a user logs out.
    No more infinite redirects on login.
    The modal window can now be reused without reloading the page (the action is does it performs is no longer repetead).
    Fixed the urls where a double slash (//) was used.
    With the new download log, files that belong to groups can also be tracked when a client downloads it.
    Options are now saved correctly every time.
    Sorting files/users/groups by date now works with any set format.

Other notes

    The new password storing system requires that all curent accounts generate a new one. The security has been improved at the cost of this minor issue.
    The remember me checkbox has been temporarily removed. A more secure implementation is planned.
    The version number is not visible for unlogged users.
    jQuery is now loaded locally.
    The UI has been normalized (menu, button and messages styles, margins, layouts).
