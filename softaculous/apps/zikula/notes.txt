1) Please dont change $ZConfig['System']['system.chmod_dir'] = 0777; in config file as it is same i.e. 0777 when installed manually on cPanel also.
2) We dont provide upgrade from version less than v1.3.5 because database changes is not done and it pops error when we visit /{path}/upgrade.php. Please check for upgrade process in next version.
3) We copy the mod_upgrade.php for auto upgrade and then after auto upgrade we revert the original file orig_upgrade.php
Added the below changes twice (this has to be added before the other condition in if statement) :
empty($_POST['softlogin']) && ( We have disabled this in 1.4.1. For major version upgrade method is different.)
4) We have kept config.php bcoz it is required for upgrade from 1.3.x to 1.4.x. Kindly check upgrade process for 1.4.x to 1.4.x in next update and add it.
