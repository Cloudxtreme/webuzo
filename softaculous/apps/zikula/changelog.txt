CHANGELOG - ZIKULA 1.4.x
------------------------

* 1.4.1 (2015-11-23)

 - BC Breaks:
     - Removed `Zikula\Core\Api\AbstractApi` that was introduced only in 1.4.0 (#2494)
     - If you use the Imagine System plugin and add custom transformations with a priority greater than 50,
       these are now applied *after* the thumbnail is generated. (#2594)
     - Removed `app/CustomBundle` but likely this was not used by anyone. (#2622)
     - Removed GroupMembershipEntity. This is very unlikely to have been used outside the Core.
       Group membership is now available directly from GroupEntity::users. A user's memberships are available
       from UserEntity::groups.
     - The change to PSR-4 for system modules (see below) will require fixing template override paths in existing themes.
 - Deprecated:
     - Twig function `pageAddVar()` deprecated. Use `pageAddAsset()` or `pageSetVar()` instead.
 - Fixes:
    - Fixed 'Removetrailingslash' error (#2552)
    - Corrected variable name in BootstrapTheme template override (#2557)
    - Fixed `categories_admin_view.js` not present in 1.4.0 dist (#2637)
    - Routes Module updated to v1.0.1
        - Non-custom routes are no longer stored in the DB. This increases pageload speed and reduces need for reloading often.

    - All system modules and themes updated to PSR-4 (#2563, #2424)
    - TranslatorTrait added (#2560)

    - Improved multilingual UI in general settings (#2547)
    - [Imagine Plugin] Possibility to add transformations which are applied after the thumbnail 
        is generated. (#2594)
    - Add umask support
 - Core-2.0 Features:
    - Add Twig-based theme engine (refs #1753)
         - Please note that the Blocks functionality of the theme engine is still in heavy development and shouldn't be
           relied upon as a permanent API. Method names and/or signature may change. The following are likely unstable:
            - Zikula\Core\Controller\AbstractBlockController (entire class)
            - Zikula\Core\AbstractTheme::generateThemedBlock
            - Zikula\Core\Theme\Engine::wrapBlockInTheme
    - Add `pageAddAsset()` Twig function and enable 'weighting' of assets to specify load order. (#2606, #2596, #1324)
    - Add `polyfill()` Twig tag to enable JS library inclusion. (#2629)
    - Core-2.0 Theme Specification finalized and enabled (#1753, #2500, #2560)

    - Implement method for a module to declare the Entities that are categorizable (#411 - was actually done in Core-1.4.0)
