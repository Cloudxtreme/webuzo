		<english-overview>
		<font size="5" color="#182e7a">Scala</font> is an acronym for "Scalable Language". This means that Scala grows with you. You can play with it by typing one-line expressions and observing the results. But you can also rely on it for large mission critical systems, as many companies, including Twitter, LinkedIn, or Intel do.
		<br /><br />
		Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java's and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.
		<br /><br />
		Scala is distributed under the <a href="http://scala-lang.org/license.html" target="_blank">3-clause BSD license</a>

			<h3>Object-Oriented</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Functional</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Even though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Seamless Java Interop</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Scala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Functions are Objects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Scala's approach is to develop a small set of core constructs that can be combined in flexible ways.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Future-Proof</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Scala particularly shines when it comes to scalable server software that makes use of concurrent and synchronous processing, parallel utilization of multiple cores, and distributed processing in the cloud.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Fun</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Maybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.</li>
			</ul>
