1. Do not install multiple times for sample data. Take sample data sql from joomla package and change dbprefix
2. Choose Database Type "MySQLi"
3. For languages download the packages here :
http://community.joomla.org/translations/joomla-3-translations.html
4. Simply unzip the packages in joomla30/languages/ folder the structure is as it is in their package
5. Most of the language packages are in correct structure some have wrong structure so you will need to ZIP manually. There should files directly in the below ZIPS :
6. Structure should be as follows :
admin_fr-FR.zip
site_fr-FR.zip
pkg_fr-FR.xml
7. In case there are changes in the structure of `extensions` or `update_sites_extensions` table in database make changes in install.php for languages
8. Languages need to be updated for 3.5.1

					<option value="el-GR">Greek</option>
					<option value="fr-FR">French</option>
					<option value="he-IL">Hebrew</option> (3.1.1v1)
					<option value="ko-KR">Korean</option>
					<option value="zh-CN">Chinese</option>

9. If you get error while upgrading for deleting some files, then check "administrator/components/com_admin/script.php" file for list of files to be deleted and add them in upgrade.php. Check the complete list from the above file instead of just adding the files of current version.
